### Introduction <a name="intro"></a>

This demo was created as a final project for the Virtual Reality course at the Complutense University of Madrid, in collaboration with Laura Mazzuca.

**Eco City** aims to raise awareness about waste separation in a fun and engaging way.   
The main target group is children aged 6 to 12, but of course the game can be played at any age.

The setting of the game is a small town with a small park and an ecological island.   
The player starts the game in the main square, where he finds the mayor asking him to help him clean the city from the various garbage left by its citizens. 

The main objective of the game is to correctly recycle the various types of waste in order to earn as many points as possible.   
The player will be equipped with an inventory, so he will be able to collect the objects he finds around the city.

### Game Description <a name="descr"></a>

To earn points, the player can recycle objects in two different ways:

 1. **Throwing objects** in the containers in the city or on the ecological island, carrying them by hand.

 2. **Interact with NPCs**, to whom he will give the objects he keeps in his inventory.

When the player correctly recycles objects or completes missions assigned to him by non-player characters, he will receive a positive score, on the other hand, the player throws waste in the wrong container, points will be deducted.   
 
Interaction with the non-player characters is important to stimulate the exploration of the map, as well as the discovery of the different possibilities of reusing materials.    
Characters will leave gifts on the trophy shelf made from items received from the player.

### How to play <a name="play"></a>

This app is an augmented reality game, so you are required to have augmented reality glasses.   
Unfortunately, it was not possible to create an executable file, but it is possible to play the demo by connecting the augmented reality glasses to the pc and start the project from Unity.

 1. Connect the augmented reality glasses to the pc.

 2. Start the project from Unity.

 3. Try to collect as many points as possible.

Have fun :)
