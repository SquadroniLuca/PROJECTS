**Welcome to AllfredOne's World!**

AllfredOne was born with a strange power, he can generate clones of himself, so he can do nothing all his life, always delegating all the work to his clones.   
Our story starts when AllfredOne move in a new house, and as usual his clones must do all the work...

You and your friend play as clones of AllfredOne, and your job is to complete all the tasks AllfredOne gives you.   
Cooperation and collaboration are the key to success, as each task will ask you and your friend to draw from a shared set of resources. Be too greedy and your teammate won't have enough to complete his job; be too generous and you won't have enough.

### Game Description <a name="descr"></a>

The game is based on **controlling clones** of Allfred.   
To pass the levels the clones will have to interact with each other by exchanging statistics and cooperating to interact with the environment and fulfil their creator's wishes.

The game can be played sa single player or can be played in multiplayer (multiplayer experience is strongly recommended).

In addition to the tutorial, there are two more levels in this demo:

 1. **The House**

 2. **The Post Office**

Each level presents a main task, but the path to it is unclear so players must study their surroundings to figure out what they need to do and how to do it.   
The main tools of the players to complete a level are the statistics that AllfredOne can give to its clones, these statistics are *Strength*, *Agility*, and *Intelligence*, each of which are essential for completing tasks. 

Players need to figure out how to break down the stats, as efficiently as possible. This is not an easy task, as at the beginning of the level they will have no idea what the obstacles are and what stats they will need to overcome them.

Each statistic translates into an action that the clones can perform, the more points in that statistic, the better the clone will perform the action.   

 * ***Strength*** is equivalent to its ability to move certain objects in the environment, such as crates and packages.
 
 * ***Agility*** is the ability to jump and move faster, more points in agility means higher jumps and faster movements.
 
 * ***Intelligence*** is the ability to interact with mechanisms in the environment such as buttons and levers. The colors of the buttons and levers suggest how many intelligences points the clone needs to activate them.

 AlfredOne won't offer his help (he's too lazy to do that) but he will give players some tips on what to do and, most importantly, act as a bank of clone statistics.
