### Introduction <a name="intro"></a>

**Magic Library** is based on one of the physical prototypes realised at the State University of Milan for the Game Design and Programming exam and later developed during the Artificial Intelligence for Video Games course at the Complutense University of Madrid, in which the protagonist is a young witch.

The aim of this level, set inside a library, is to reach the secret entrance of the restricted section without being discovered by the caretaker.   

In order to reach the door, the player can make his way through the shelves and move them to create new paths, but be careful because some of these can make noise and attract the caretaker.

This project focuses on the behaviour of the caretaker.   
In particular, a reactive artificial intelligence has been developed, which changes the behaviour of the caretaker according to the actions performed by the player and the inputs he receives from his surroundings.

### Game Description <a name="descr"></a>

The player must move around the library and find out the key to open the door.

To succeed, the player can create new paths by moving certain shelves or by using special spells.

In fact, some shelves are enchanted and can move, the only problem is that they make noise while moving and the noise attracts the caretaker and he will rearrange the shelf, closing the passage.

By using spell books instead, the player can permanently open new passages by reducing the size of the shelf.

**WARNING:** if the caretaker sees you he will start to follow you, and if he catches you it's ***GAME OVER***
