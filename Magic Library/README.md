### Introduction <a name="intro"></a>

**PAC-Car** is a game inspired by the famous PAC-MAN.

In this version the protagonist is a thief who has to collect as much money as possible, while the colourful ghosts are represented by the police cars that have to catch him.

When the player collects a power up... you will only find out what happens when you play :)

### Game Description <a name="descr"></a>

Two game modes are currently available.

 * **ARCADE:** the classic mode in which the game ends either when the player's lives are over or when all the money has been collected.

 * **INFINITY:** in which the collected money regenerates after a certain time and there are no lives but a counter indicating how many times the player has been arrested.

In particular *INFINITY* mode is perfect when you want to challenge each other among friends.

### How to play <a name="play"></a>

This application is currently only available for Android devices.

 1. In order to play PAC-CAR, you must download the .apk file in the folder and install it on your device.

 2. As it is an augmented reality application, you need to download the image in the folder to your PC (or you can print it out).

 3. Once you have started the application and chosen the mode you want to play with, you have to frame the picture you have downloaded or printed with your phone.

Have fun :)

### Important things to remember <a name="nb"></a>

 * This project was realised in collaboration with **Laura Mazzuca**.

 * This application is currently ***ONLY*** available for Android devices.

 * This project is still a ***prototype***, so there may be bugs (which you can report to us to improve the game).

 * **ATTENTION:** it is recommended to frame the image at a certain distance, so that the whole map can be visible on the screen.
